            <h3>Tembusu and the Commodification of Urban Trees in Singapore</h3>
            <p>4.181 Financial Forms, Fall 2023</p>

            Urban trees have been instrumentalized for different purposes: sequestering carbon, providing ecosystem services, rendering shade, mitigating urban heat island, offsetting deforestation, aiding economy, increasing property value, reducing heat islands, preventing runoff, filtering pollution, shaping national image. In order to carry out the roles, they have been measured, curated, commodified, financialized, quantified, assessed, utilized, sensed, controlled, engineered, extracted, valuated, transacted.
            Singapore, in particular, has envisioned itself as a “City in Nature”1—a city that preserves, grows, and restores its natural capital—and integrates nature, both land-based and vertically, into its urban area by planting flowering trees and bushes.
            On the other hand, the land-scarce island exhibits a tension between perpetual growth and natural conservation since property development consistently presents the untapped forests as viable real estate, as instanced by the accidental destruction of a forest in Kranji2, in the northern part of the island, by a development company.
            I'm trying to document the multifaceted, sometimes in contention with each other, portraits of micro-narratives of the natural capital and urban trees in Singapore; the attempts that point towards instrumentalization and possibily otherwise; when the tree becomes a service and when the tree wants to be... a tree. In this case, I will also specifically focus on the Tembusu tree, or Fagraea fragrans, as the main subject of inquiry, due to its ubiquity and familiarity as an urban tree in Singapore.

            <h3>THE BIG BIRD, THE CASTED FEET, AND THE WARTY PIG: Cement extraction and Indonesia's new capital through scales</h3>
            <p>4.228 Contemporary Urbanism Proseminar, Fall 2023</p>

            Since the early 2000s, somewhere between 110
            and 150 new cities have emerged across Asia
            and Africa[1]. From the oxymoronic Neom in
            Saudi Arabia, to a “new Singapore” right across
            the real Singapore in Johor strait. Indonesia,
            Egypt, South Korea, and South Sudan are
            moving their capitals. Constructing new cities
            is lucrative, providing new ways to rebrand
            themselves[2] and open up new large-scale
            investment opportunities. In contrary, while
            many of the new cities bring up new standards
            of sustainability and carbon emissions, the rate
            of material movement from construction and
            agricultural activity surpassed, by an order of
            ten, that of geological processes[3].
            This research specifically focuses on the
            construction of Indonesia's new capital city
            in East Kalimantan—a city currently under
            construction that rapidly materializes in realtime.
            The city embodies a narrative of a “forest
            city,”[4] a “carbon-neutral city,”[5] and a “green
            and smart city,”[6] among other titles. It seems
            poised to be the antithesis of the Jakarta we
            know. Beyond the grand narrative, issues related
            to forest conservation, oligarchs' conflict of
            interest, foreign investment, indigenous land
            struggle, and environmental concerns loom
            large. Its future is contested, and so is its past.
            Furthermore, the research attempts to invite
            us to rethink the geological, ecological, and
            social cost of constructing a new “green”
            and “sustainable” megaproject from scratch.
            Trans-scalar inquiries at the sites of cement
            extraction—one specific material of widespread
            use in the construction—and its impact on the
            more extensive socio-ecological conditions will
            be the starting point of the research.
